#### Intro to the Zotero API

Hmm.. suggests that I get the libZotero GIT library. Not necessary, but I guess I will. Hmm, having the same problems as with the other tutorial, re: python. Alright, same thing worked `python -m pip install libZotero` while in the Python27 directory.

Gotta make something in the text editor now.

Ran ImportZotero.py. Presumably that Worked?

file path is "C:\Users\Thomas\Documents\School Work\Carleton\Winter 2016\HIST 5702\Research-Notebook\APITutorials\ZoteroAPI.py"

Hmm... I want to use my own Zotero library here, but I don't know where to find the information they're asking for. Oh, I think I need an online account for that. Hmmm... still doesn't seem to be working. I'll just use their stuff.

Huh, trying to run CreateZlib.py and it's saying that "zotero" isn't defined. Maybe the import didn't work?

OOoooh, I think these need to be in the same file. DUH! Tutorial should be way clearly about that.

It's saying I should have some output from this. But I'm running it right now and it's not working. Is that what I supposed to do? Am I supposed to be running this in a python interpreter? God, this tutorial is awful.

Tried it in the Python Interpreter. Nope, didn't work. Do I need the sample library? I have no clue what it means to have that, because the tutorial doesn't tell me, because it's terrible.
