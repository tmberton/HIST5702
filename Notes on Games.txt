"Spatial Storytelling," Emily Bembeneck, Play the Past

  Looking at telling story through locations in games.

  Space, rather than time, usually marks progress through a game narrative. Interesting point. When temporal change does happen, it's often trigger by a simple "if/then" flag, so that it's not a passage of time, but simply a "static place represented different ways."

  As usual, the frustrating conflation of "video game" with "game."

  Archaelogy also marks time through space.

  "Our minds may value space more than they do time."
